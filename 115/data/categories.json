Cypress tried to locate elements based on this query:\n\n> cy.get(@randomRow)\n\nWe initially found matching element(s), but while waiting for them to become actionable, they disappeared from the page. Common situations why this happens:\n  - Your JS framework re-rendered asynchronously\n  - Your app code reacted to an event firing and removed the element\n\nYou can typically solve this by breaking up a chain. For example, rewrite:\n\n> `cy.get('button').click().click()`\n\nto\n\n> `cy.get('button').as('btn').click()`\n> `cy.get('@btn').click()`\n\nhttps://on.cypress.io/element-has-detached-from-dom","children":[{"name":"JS/TC_01.02!00_105_UnReg | Markets > Menu item [Shares] > Click two random trading instruments on the widget \"Trading instrument\"","uid":"38f1da1cbe1adecf","parentUid":"b5fb80ef567099990a2f0b2a443516fd","status":"broken","time":{"start":1714329689541,"stop":1714329710476,"duration":20935},"flaky":false,"newFailed":false,"newPassed":false,"newBroken":false,"retriesCount":0,"retriesStatusChange":false,"parameters":[],"tags":[]}],"uid":"b5fb80ef567099990a2f0b2a443516fd"}],"uid":"bdbf199525818fae7a8651db9eafe741"}],"name":"categories"}
